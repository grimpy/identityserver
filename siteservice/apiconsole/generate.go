package apiconsole

/*
OK, mulesofts api-console is nice to render the raml files.
I don't want to run a node server or run bower on the server nor do I want to check in all uncleaned bower packages.
Only a clean distribution of the api-console. Luckily mulesoft has just that in their git repo.

Using github svn access is a trick to download that subfolder, next, package it using go-bindata to include the files in the binary.
